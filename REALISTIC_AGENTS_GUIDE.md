## 🎪 EXAMPLE REALISTIC SCENARIOS

### **Scenario 1: Tight Deadline Pressure**
**You**: "Can we skip testing to meet the deadline?"
- **Developer**: "That's concerning - skipping tests creates technical debt that'll bite us later. What if we prioritize the critical paths?"
- **Manager**: "I understand the pressure, but what's our risk if we ship with bugs? Client won't be happy with a broken product."
- **QA**: "I'd strongly advise against it. We could at least do smoke testing on core features. What's the minimum viable testing scope?"

### **Scenario 2: Feature Creep**
**You**: "Client wants to add a dashboard feature."
- **Client**: "This dashboard could give us a real competitive edge. How quickly can we get this in?"
- **Developer**: "Adding a dashboard now would require significant architecture changes. Are we talking weeks or months?"
- **Manager**: "Hold on - what's the impact on our current timeline and budget? We need to manage scope carefully."

### **Scenario 3: Team Dynamics**
**You**: "The team seems stressed about the workload."
- **HR**: "I've noticed that too. Should we discuss redistributing tasks or adjusting expectations? Burnout affects everyone."
- **Manager**: "Let's be realistic about capacity. I'd rather deliver quality work on time than rush and create problems."
- **Intern**: "I could take on more tasks if someone could guide me through the process."
