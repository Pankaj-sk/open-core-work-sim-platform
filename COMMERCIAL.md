# Commercial Licensing

## Open Source vs Commercial Use

This project is released under the **Apache 2.0 License**, which allows for:

✅ **Free use** for personal and educational purposes  
✅ **Free modification** and contribution back to the community  
✅ **Commercial use** in your own products and services  
✅ **Distribution** of modified versions
